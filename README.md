# namCol_frontend

This repository contains the development of the frontend for an interactive web application designed to promote Colombian gastronomy. The platform allows both national and international users to discover, learn, and prepare traditional Colombian recipes through a step-by-step guided experience, from selecting ingredients to the final preparation.

The interface is designed to be intuitive, dynamic, and responsive, ensuring smooth navigation across different devices. It also includes free features and premium options that enhance the experience by offering exclusive and personalized content.

The frontend consumes services provided by the backend through a REST API, ensuring efficient communication and a seamless user experience.
